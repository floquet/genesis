@article{seidelmann19821980,
	abstract = {In 1979 the Seventeenth General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in Montreal, Canada, adopted the 1979 IAU Theory of Nutation upon the recommendation of this Working Group. Subsequently the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) passed a resolution requesting that this action be reconsidered in favor of a theory based on a different Earth model. As a consequence of that reconsideration the 1980 IAU Theory of Nutation was adopted. The details of that theory and the history of its adoption are described here in the Final Report of the IAU Working Group on Nutation. A summary of these events and the essence of our recommendations is provided first while the body of the report discusses these matters in greater detail. The theory itself is contained in Table I.},

@inproceedings{olivier2008simulation,
	abstract = {This paper describes the development and initial demonstration of a new, integrated modeling and simulation framework, encompassing the space situational awareness enterprise, for quantitatively assessing the benefit of specific sensor systems, technologies and data analysis techniques. The framework is based on a flexible, scalable architecture to enable efficient, physics-based simulation of the current SSA enterprise, and to accommodate future advancements in SSA systems. In particular, the code is designed to take advantage of massively parallel computer systems available, for example, at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The details of the modeling and simulation framework are described, including hydrodynamic models of satellite intercept and debris generation, orbital propagation algorithms, radar cross section calculations, optical brightness calculations, radar system models, optical system models, object detection algorithms, orbit determination algorithms, simulation analysis and visualization tools. Future work will involve collaborative incorporation of specific Space Surveillance Network models, along with evaluation of currently unexploited sensors and prospective new sensors. There is also the possibility of providing this simulation and modeling framework to the community through a service oriented architecture.},

@article{ALI2024107378,
	abstract = {Accurately modelling crashes, and predicting crash occurrence and associated severities are a prerequisite for devising countermeasures and developing effective road safety management strategies. To this end, crash prediction modelling using machine learning has evolved over two decades. With the advent of big data that provides unprecedented opportunities to better understand the crash mechanism and its determinants, such efforts will likely be accelerated. To gear these efforts, understanding state-of-the-art machine learning-based crash prediction models becomes paramount to summarise the lessons learned from past efforts, which can assist in developing robust and accurate models. This review paper aims to address this gap by systematically reviewing the machine learning studies on crash modelling. Models are reviewed from three aspects of the application: (a) crash occurrence (or real-time crash) prediction, (b) crash frequency prediction, and (c) injury severity prediction. Further, model intricacies that impact model performance are identified and thoroughly reviewed. This comprehensive review highlights specific gaps and future research needs in three aforementioned model applications, such as improper selection of non-crash events for crash occurrence models, the inability of future forecasting of crash frequency models, and inconsistency in injury severity classes. Critical research needs relating to model development, evaluation, and application are also discussed. This review envisages methodological advancements in machine learning models for crash prediction modelling and leveraging big data to better link crashes with its determinants.},
