	abstract = {The High Accuracy Satellite Drag Model is a new initiative launched by the Air Force Space Battlelab in January 2001 to improve Air Force Space Command's ability to meet the stringent Space Surveillance Capstone Requirements for satellite trajectory prediction accuracy. For low perigee satellites, these requirements are not consistently met, largely because of current atmospheric density model errors of 15 to 20% 6. This can affect missions like high-precision sensor acquisition of satellites, maneuver planning, re-entry predictions, collision avoidance and risk analysis. The Space Battlelab decided to fund this initiative because of the substantial pay-back expected, and the fact that it involves more risk than the acquisition community or operational community are willing to fund. It is also well suited to the Space Battlelab's project criteria of demonstrating unconventional ways of using existing data and technology to meet mission requirements and being able to demonstrate this in less than 18 months. Finally, this initiative leverages off an earlier Space Battlelab project7 that demonstrated the promise the basic technique holds, even when only one satellite is used to determine the drag effects.
The initiative optimizes the earlier approach by simultaneously processing drag information from many satellite trajectories to solve for a high-resolution correction to the thermospheric density. Unlike the earlier effort, that used derived quantities from the orbit determination process, this initiative will directly process satellite tracking observations from the Space Surveillance Network. It will determine the thermospheric density correction parameters, while solving for the states of the calibration satellites, in a single estimation process, known as the Dynamic Calibration Atmosphere (DCA).},

Subsequently the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) passed a resolution requesting that this action be reconsidered in favor of a theory based on a different Earth model. As a consequence of that reconsideration the 1980 IAU Theory of Nutation was adopted. The details of that theory and the history of its adoption are described here in the Final Report of the IAU Working Group on Nutation. A summary of these events and the essence of our recommendations is provided first while the body of the report discusses these matters in greater detail. The theory itself is contained in Table I.},

	abstract = {Visualized data often have dubious origins and quality. Di erent forms of uncertainty and errors are also introduced as the data are derived, transformed, interpolated, and nally rendered. In the absence of integrated presentation of data and uncertainty, the analysis of the visualization is incomplete at best and often leads to inaccurate or incorrect conclusions. This paper surveys techniques for presenting data together with uncertainty. These uncertainty visualization techniques present data in such a manner that users are made aware of the locations and degree of uncertainties in their data so as to make more informed analyses and decisions. The techniques include adding glyphs, adding geometry, modifying geometry, modifying attributes, animation, soni cation, and psycho-visual approaches. We present our results in uncertainty visualization for environmental visualization, surface interpolation, global illumination with radiosity, ow visualization, and gure animation. We also present a classi cation of the possibilities in uncertainty visualization, and locate our contributions within this classi cation.},

	abstract = {In this paper we introduce a new indexing scheme for progressive traversal and visualization of large regular grids. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by providing a tool that displays at interactive rates planar slices of scalar field data with very modest computing resources. We obtain unprecedented results both in terms of absolute performance and, more importantly, in terms of scalability. On a laptop computer we provide real time interaction with a 20483 grid (8 Giga-nodes) using only 20MB of memory. On an SGI Onyx we slice interactively an 81923 grid (½ tera-nodes) using only 60MB of memory. The scheme relies simply on the determination of an appropriate reordering of the rectilinear grid data and a progressive construction of the output slice. The reordering minimizes the amount of I/O performed during the out-of-core computation. The progressive and asynchronous computation of the output provides flexible quality/speed tradeoffs and a time-critical and interruptible user interface.},

@book{morris1996analysis,
	abstract = {Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is a Lagrangian, numerical method for modelling uid dynamics. The uid is represented by particles, typically of xed mass, which follow the uid motion, advecting contact discontinuities, preserving Galilean invariance, and reducing the computational di usion of various uid properties including momentum. The equations governing the evolution of the uid become expressions for inter-particle forces and uxes when written in SPH form. It often possible to formulate SPH such that mass, momentum and energy are conserved exactly. Several reviews of SPH have been published, including Benz (1989) and Monaghan (1992). This chapter covers much of the theory upon which SPH is based and introduces the reader to the standard equations used in most applications of SPH. SPH was rst developed to simulate astrophysical uid dynamics, in particular polytropes (Lucy 1977, Gingold & Monaghan 1977). It is relatively easy to incorporate complicated physical e ects into the SPH formalism and thus SPH has been applied successfully to a vast range of problems. These include elastic ow (Swegle 1992), magnetohydrodynamics (see Chapt. 3), quasi-incompressible hydrodynamics (Monaghan 1994), gravity currents (Monaghan 1995c), the fracture of brittle solids (Benz & Asphaug 1993), the interaction of a weak shock with a bubble of gas (x 5.2. 3) and accretion onto a pulsar magnetosphere (Chapt. 4) to name a few. SPH is an extremely versatile method, however, the errors in results can sometimes be substantially larger than those obtained using methods tailored for a speci c problem. There are many problems, though, which can only be practically handled by SPH. Problems where the geometry is highly irregular, or even dynamic, for example, are quite readily handled by SPH. There are many applications where the Lagrangian nature of SPH can be exploited to give accurate results without requiring the use of complicated grid re nement algorithms. For example, in early implementations of SPH the global particle resolution length (smoothing length) was decreased or increased depending on the average density of the system.},

@techreport{liou2009orbital,
	abstract = {Although NASA has conducted research on orbital debris since the 1960s, the NASA Orbital Debris Program Office is now considered to have been established in October 1979, following the recognition by senior NASA officials of orbital debris as a space environmental issue and the allocation by NASA Headquarters Advanced Programs Office to the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) of funds specifically dedicated for orbital debris investigations. In the 30 years since, the NASA Orbital Debris Program Office has pioneered the characterization of the orbital debris environment and its potential effects on current and future space systems, has developed comprehensive orbital debris mitigation measures, and has led efforts by the international aerospace community in addressing the challenges posed by orbital debris. In 1967 the Flight Analysis Branch at the Manned Spacecraft Center (renamed the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in 1973) evaluated the risks of collisions between an Apollo spacecraft and orbital debris. Three years later the same group calculated collision risks for the forthcoming Skylab space station, which was launched in 1973. By 1976, the nucleus of NASA s yet-to-be-formed orbital debris research efforts, including Andrew Potter, Burton Cour-Palais, and Donald Kessler, was found in JSC s Environmental Effects Office, examining the potential threat of orbital debris to large space platforms, in particular the proposed Solar Power Satellites (SPS).

Satellite collisions would produce orbiting fragments, each of which would increase the probability of further collisions, leading to the growth of a belt of debris around the earth. This process parallels certain theories concerning the growth of the asteroid belt. The debris flux in such an earth‐orbiting belt could exceed the natural meteoroid flux, affecting future spacecraft designs. A mathematical model was used to predict the rate at which such a belt might form. Under certain conditions the belt could begin to form within this century and could be a significant problem during the next century. The possibility that numerous unobserved fragments already exist from spacecraft explosions would decrease this time interval. However, early implementation of specialized launch constraints and operational procedures could significantly delay the formation of the belt.},

@article{ALI2024107378,
	abstract = {Accurately modelling crashes, and predicting crash occurrence and associated severities are a prerequisite for devising countermeasures and developing effective road safety management strategies. To this end, crash prediction modelling using machine learning has evolved over two decades. With the advent of big data that provides unprecedented opportunities to better understand the crash mechanism and its determinants, such efforts will likely be accelerated. To gear these efforts, understanding state-of-the-art machine learning-based crash prediction models becomes paramount to summarise the lessons learned from past efforts, which can assist in developing robust and accurate models. This review paper aims to address this gap by systematically reviewing the machine learning studies on crash modelling. Models are reviewed from three aspects of the application: (a) crash occurrence (or real-time crash) prediction, (b) crash frequency prediction, and (c) injury severity prediction. Further, model intricacies that impact model performance are identified and thoroughly reviewed. This comprehensive review highlights specific gaps and future research needs in three aforementioned model applications, such as improper selection of non-crash events for crash occurrence models, the inability of future forecasting of crash frequency models, and inconsistency in injury severity classes. Critical research needs relating to model development, evaluation, and application are also discussed. This review envisages methodological advancements in machine learning models for crash prediction modelling and leveraging big data to better link crashes with its determinants.},

@article{Wang:2010aa,
	abstract = {The collision between the active American Iridium 33 satellite and the retired Russian Cosmos 2251 satellite on 10 February 2009, is the first on-orbit collision between satellites. As of 1 December 2009, the U.S. space tracking system catalogued 1,632 fragments from the collision, many of which will stay in orbit for decades. This paper estimates the total number, size, area-to-mass ratio, and relative velocity of the catalogued fragments; calculates the lifetime and orbital evolution of the fragments; and evaluates the short- and long-term hazards they pose in the space environment. It is shown that previous estimates of the probability that an intact object in space will collide with another object appear to be lower than is indicated by observed collisions. How the collision probability depends on the shapes of the colliding objects is analyzed, and results indicate that including shape dependence will increase estimates of collision probability. Previous analyses have not considered the effects of satellites appendages, which lead to an underestimation of the long-term space debris population.},
